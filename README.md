# ProLog1

Varouis Practices of using prolog and compare different parts of logic 


This assignment gives you practice working with list processing in Prolog.  Write a Prolog program to solve the given multi-part problem below.  Make sure you thoroughly test all your solutions for parts a-h.  If your solution gives multiple answers, make certain all answers given are correct.  Name your part b) function “my_member”
instead of member; otherwise, use the predicate name given in each sub-problem. 
 Code your own solution to each sub-problem.  Don’t use built-in functions.    

Write a Prolog program to implement each of the following functions, 
where the variables represent elements or lists. 

a. equalLists(x, y) tests whether the lists x and y are equal. 
b. member(x, y) tests whether x is an element of the list y. 
c. all(x, y) is the list obtained from list y by removing all occurrences of x. 
d. makeSet(x) is the list obtained from x by deleting repeated elements. 
e. subset(x, y) tests whether x, considered as a set, is a subset of y. 
f. equalSets(x, y) tests whether x and y, considered as sets, are equal. 
g. subBag(x, y) tests whether x, considered as a bag, is a sub-bag of y. 
h. equalBags(x, y) tests whether the bags x and y are equal.
